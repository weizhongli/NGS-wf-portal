<PRE>
If you downloading the whole gzipped file (e.g. jobid.tar.gz), please unpack it with command such as
"tar xvzf jobid.tar.gz", this will extract all the computed results in your current
directory, following are the file and directory list you may see:

NGS-config
    Configuration file and parameters

NGS-samples
    List of samples users selected to run with this workflow

NGS-env
    Environmental variables from the server where the jobs are executed

Sample_<n>
    Here n is a number, corrsponding to the samples in NGS-samples file.
    This is a directory that results for this sample are stored.
    This directory can have several sub-directories with results from
    individual tools (e.g. tophat, cufflinks).
    Within each sub-directory (.e.g. tophat), all necessary results
    can be found. For example with tophat:
        accepted_hits.bam
        align_summary.txt
        deletions.bed
        insertions.bed
        junctions.bed
        logs
        prep_reads.info
        unmapped.bam

Sample_<job_name>
    Here job_name is self explanatory, the job is an analysis on all the samples or group of samples.
    This is a directory that stores all the results for the analysis. For example
    Sample_diff_group1_n_group2 is the cuffdiff results between your two groups of samples.

WF-sh
    This is a directory that stores the actual shell scripts, all the parameters
    can be found here.
