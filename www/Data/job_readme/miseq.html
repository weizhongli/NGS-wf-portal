<h2>Results summary for CD-HIT-OTU-MiSeq</h2>
If you download the whole gzipped file (e.g. jobid.tar.gz), please unpack it with command such as
"tar xvzf jobid.tar.gz", this will extract all the computed results in your current
directory, following are the files and directories you may see:

NGS-samples
    List of samples 

NGS-env
    Environmental variables from the server where the jobs were executed
