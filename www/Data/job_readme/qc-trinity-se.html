<h2>Results summary for Trinity and post analysis workflow</h2>
If you download the whole gzipped file (e.g. jobid.tar.gz), please unpack it with command such as
"tar xvzf jobid.tar.gz", this will extract all the computed results in your current
directory, following are the files and directories you may see:

NGS-config
    Configuration file and parameters

NGS-samples
    List of samples 

NGS-env
    Environmental variables from the server where the jobs were executed

Trinity_assembly_from_pooled_samples
    This directory has the assembled transcripts by Trinity from the reads 
    pooled from all the samples.
        trinity-pe/Trinity.fasta: assembled transcripts
        compare-trinity-to-ref/Trinity_vs_S_pombe_refTrans.blastn: blast results of assembled transcripts against reference transcripts

Sample_Name
    This is a directory where results for this sample are stored.
    This directory can have several sub-directories with results from
    individual tools. Within this directory, all necessary results can be found, e.g.
        bowtie.bam: alignments of the reads to the assembled transcript by Trinity 
        bowtie.bam.bai
        RSEM.genes.results: RSEM-estimated abundance values
        RSEM.isoforms.results
        RSEM.isoforms.results.ok
        RSEM.stat/RSEM.cnt
        RSEM.stat/RSEM.model
        RSEM.stat/RSEM.theta

Sample-all-transcript-matrix-group
    Post analysis of differentially expressed transcripts
        post-RSEM-group/Trinity_genes.counts.matrix
        post-RSEM-group/Trinity_genes.not_cross_norm.fpkm.tmp
        post-RSEM-group/Trinity_genes.not_cross_norm.fpkm.tmp.TMM_info.txt
        post-RSEM-group/Trinity_genes.TMM.fpkm.matrix

        post-RSEM-group/WF.cpu
        post-RSEM-group/WF.start.date

WF-sh
    This is a directory that stores the actual shell scripts, all the parameters
    can be found here.
