<h2>Results summary for Tophat Cufflink and Cuffdiff workflow</h2>
If you download the whole gzipped file (e.g. jobid.tar.gz), please unpack it with command such as
"tar xvzf jobid.tar.gz", this will extract all the computed results in your current
directory, following are the files and directories you may see:

NGS-config
    Configuration file and parameters

NGS-samples
    List of samples

NGS-env
    Environmental variables from the server where the jobs are executed

Sample_name
    This is a directory where results for this sample are stored.
    This directory can have several sub-directories with results from
    individual tools (e.g. tophat, cufflinks).
    Within each sub-directory (.e.g. tophat), all necessary results
    can be found. For example with tophat:
        accepted_hits.bam: mapping results
        align_summary.txt: mapping summary
        deletions.bed
        insertions.bed
        junctions.bed
        logs
        prep_reads.info
        unmapped.bam
    within cufflink:
        genes.fpkm_tracking
        isoforms.fpkm_tracking
        transcripts.gtf

Merged_transcripts_from_all_samples
    Merged transcripts by cuffmerge from transcripts from all samples
        cuffmerge/merged.gtf

Group1_vs_Group2 (or Group1_vs_Group3 etc)
    cuffdiff results between samples of group1 and 2
